The Health Monitor Big Screen is developed as part of the OpenRank competition to evaluate and visualize project health metrics using OpenDigger data.

## About this project

An online-accessible, interactive visualization screen for monitoring and comparing project health metrics. Data is sourced from OpenDigger and processed for visualization and strategic decision-making.

The project is powered by Vue and Echarts, and aims to help enterprises optimize resource allocation and project management strategies.

+ Access the application online by typing the following URL into your browser:[项目健康度指标可视化平台](https://github.com/X-Ethan/2025-1.1-/blob/main/index.html)
### Docker deployment

1. **Install Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed on your system. Follow the instructions in the official documentation: [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

2. **Pull images**: Download the Docker image for the application using the following command:

   ```bash
   docker pull openrank/health-monitor:latest
   ```

3. **Run the container**: Start the application by running:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8081:8081 openrank/health-monitor
   ```

   - The `-d` flag runs the container in the background.
   - The `-p 8081:8081` maps the container's port to the host system.

4. **Access the application**: Once the container is running, open `http://localhost:8081` in your browser to access the application. Use `docker stop container-id` to stop the container when needed.

  npm run serve
  ```

## Introduction to the Health Monitor Visualization Screen

### Scenario and meaning

Monitoring project health is crucial for enterprises to identify high-potential projects, optimize resource allocation, and mitigate risks. By visualizing health metrics such as activity, community engagement, code quality, and development trends, the application helps stakeholders make informed decisions efficiently.

### Realization

The data for this big screen is sourced from:

- [OpenDigger](https://github.com/X-lab2017/open-digger)
- [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)

Technology stack: Vue 2.6, Echarts 5.3, RESTful API.

### Key Features

#### **Health Metrics**

1. **Recent Activity Count**: Evaluates whether a project is active and attracting new users or contributors. When selecting open-source projects, developers prefer joining highly active ones, as this usually indicates frequent maintenance, quick issue resolution, and fast feature iteration.
2. **New Contributor Growth Rate**: Measures the project's attractiveness and its ability to expand the community. This metric is useful for project maintenance teams to monitor the health of the community. A low or negative growth rate may suggest a decline in the project's appeal, prompting actions like organizing events or improving documentation.
3. **Issue Response Rate**: Monitors the community's ability to support user feedback. A high response rate boosts user and developer confidence in the project, whereas a low response rate may lead to reduced community activity.
4. **Code Change Stability**:Assesses the project's stability and maturity, particularly for systems requiring long-term maintenance. Projects with unstable code changes may experience frequent large-scale modifications, potentially impacting version compatibility.
5. **Code Issue Density**:Evaluates the project's potential risks. High code issue density may indicate problems with code quality, affecting development efficiency or product reliability.
6. **OpenRank Trends**:Assesses the project's influence within the open-source ecosystem. This metric is used to observe whether a project is in a rapid development phase, making it suitable for long-term collaboration or investment decisions.
7. **Pull Request Acceptance Rate**:Measures the project's openness to external contributions. A high acceptance rate reflects a contributor-friendly project, while a low acceptance rate may discourage contributors, leading to their loss.

#### Data from a wide range of sources

The data for this large screen comes from 

- [X-lab2017](https://github.com/X-lab2017)
- [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)

The API of X-Lab2017 contains information about a wide variety of open source projects, as follows

The Github API also allows you to find additional information, such as a map of the project's language distribution.

#### **Dynamic Interactive Queries**

The platform enables interactive querying by project name or author, dynamically updating the visualizations based on user inputs. For example, entering **X-lab2017/open-digger** will display data specific to that repository.
